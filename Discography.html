  <h5 class="center-align"> This section has the complete Queen album discography. This is a list of all their albums in order of release date but only those albums released as Queen. Queen has to have one of the best back catalogues in music history. The Queen musical legacy has broken records worldwide. As of March 2021, Queens Greatest Hits 1 has spent over 940 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and it has also been certified 20 times platinum with sales of over 6 million copies, making it the best-selling album of all time in the United Kingdom. </h5>

  <img src="./images/discography 37.jpeg"><h4>Queen I (July 13, 1973)</h4>
  <br> This is Queen’s 1973 debut album and is probably one of their their most underrated album of that decade. At this stage, 
  Queen had signed a deal with Trident and they had many musical ideas which they were trying out on the album. The self titled album Queen, 
  was recorded during studio off time, when the studio was not being used by more famous artists. Also, this was Freddie’s first opportunity to avail 
  of a full size piano. Already in this album you can hear Brian May’s orchestrated guitar harmonies, the multi-tracked vocal harmonies, 
  imaginative lyrics and musical dynamics which could change from heavy rock to a piano ballad in seconds.

    <img src="./images/discography 36.jpeg"><h4>Queen II (March 8, 1974)</h4>
    <br> The Queen II album had side 1 called “White” and Side 2 called “Black” and funnily enough Brian May had all the songs (bar one) on the white side and Mercury had all the songs on the black side. This Queen II album gave Queen their breakthrough into the UK charts, getting to No.5 in the charts, an improvement of 19 places over the first album. Even with this, it was not thought of as a good album – Rolling Stone in 1974 called it a ” floundering and sadly unoriginal affair “.

      <img src="./images/discography 35.jpeg"width="77%"><h4>Sheer Heart Attack(November 8, 1974)</h4>
      <br> Sheer Heart Attack, was Queens prelude to greatness – it reached number 2 in the UK Album charts and not for lack of trying. The album itself is excellent and pulls no punches by getting straight in there and hitting you with the classic Brian May piece, ‘Brighton Rock’ followed by Queens first real chart hit, ‘Killer Queen’.Brian May also gets his own songs added to the Queen mix. With ‘Now I’m here’, ‘Dear Friends’ and ‘She Makes Me’ as well as contributing an excellent guitar section to ‘Stone Cold Crazy’ which is a very popular cover by bands like Metallica.

        <img src="./images/discography 34.jpeg"width="65%"><h4>A Night At The Opera (November 21, 1975)</h4>
        <br> 
        Queens ‘A Night at the Opera’, is consistently listed in those ‘Top Albums of All time’ style polls which you often see, and for good reason too – it’s​ an excellent album. It ranked #43 in Q Magazines Top Albums poll of 1993 and Mojo Magazine said it was ‘An imperial extravaganza, a cornucopia’. The album is named after the Marx brothers film of the same name, which the band watched during the recording.

          <img src="./images/discography 33.jpeg"><h4>A Day at the Races <br>(December 10, 1976)</h4>
          <br> Queen continued the theme of calling the album after a Marx Brothers film. The album itself starts with one of Queens best early rockers, ‘Tie Your Mother Down’ penned by Brian May and described by the Times as ‘ … Sheer bloody poetry ‘ . Freddie again demonstrates his expertise on the piano with ‘You Take My Breath Away’, which is a moving piece of music which some documentaries used after Freddie’s​ death. The remaining songs on Side 1, ‘Long Away’, ‘The Millionaire Waltz’, and ‘You And I’, all well worth a listen.
          On Side B, there are two songs which ended up on the Greatest Hits compilation, the Aretha Franklin-influenced ‘Somebody to Love’ and the retro-sounding​​ ‘Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy’ which Freddie called another of his ‘vaudeville numbers’ ; There’s even a song with a chorus in Japanese – ‘Teo Torriate (Let Us Cling Together)’ penned by Brian was inspired by Queens early tours of Japan.

            <img src="./images/discography 32.jpeg"><h4>News Of The World (October 28, 1977)</h4>
            <br> When ‘News of the World’ was released in 1977, the influence of punk in the UK was growing and was obvious in the charts. By sheer coincidence​, a track called ‘ Sheer Heart Attack ‘ was written around the time of the Sheer Heart Attack album was included on News of the World, and that song has punkish tendencies​ which may have helped the album in the UK charts of the time.

                  <br> 
                  The Jazz Album has had varied reviews over the years, some say it lacked inventiveness and that Queen were running out of ideas, where-as others say it was well produced and inventive. At the time the album was released, many of the music reviews slated the album, NME said “ I’d like to care for Queen in the same way, as in the beginning of seventies, but it’s imposible.” … they were right in one sence – in that this is not a heavy album ; ‘Dead on Time’ is probably the heaviest song on the album. I feel the album could have done with a bit more influence from Brian May – the Red Special wasn’t as active as it was in other albums.

                    <img src="./images/discography 30.jpeg"><h4>Queen, Live Killers <br>(June 26, 1979)</h4>
                    <br>Live Albums are either loved or hated, and this is a particularly good one, especially for the era, when technology wasn’t at its peak. Even Brian admitted that he was unsatisfied and that there were serious sound problems during the concerts. “There were concerts that we had sounded great but then when we listened to the tapes they sounded awful.”, says Brian – which is why he dislikes the album. Apparently, there were about 20 concerts recorded but only 3 or 4 could be used on the final album.
                    The Record Mirror said of Live Killers, ‘It is a triumph … it’s not just filling the time before the next studio release. Listen to it … you won’t​ be disappointed.”

                      <img src="./images/discography 29.jpeg"><h4>The Game (june 30, 1980)</h4>
                      <br> The Game, as an album was more ‘designed’ than just being a selection of songs written for inclusion on an album. They paid particular attention to trying to keep the album from going in too many directions at once. According to Brian, the album had a theme and an attempt was made at creating a coherent album. To do this, there was no limit made on the time spent in the studio and some songs just flowed out in this way. Another change to previous albums was polyphonic synths, which Roger wanted to use on the album. The Game was the first Queen album to use synthesizers (an Oberheim OBX). Also, Queen had a new engineer, Mack, in new studios in Munich. Mack gave Queen new techniques to edit and reorder sections of songs, in ways that Queen never used before.

                            <br> 
                            The Flash Gordon album is actually the only Queen album which I don’t possess, as I didn’t feel that it was a studio album, but rather a soundtrack turned into an album. With the exception of “Flash’s Theme” and ‘The Hero’, the rest of the album has a lot of instrumentation as well as various sound bytes from the film ‘Flash Gordon’. That being said, my Spotify often randomly selects tracks from the Flash Gordon soundtrack and I do actually like the ambients and the instrumental tracks when that happens. 
                            Queen only saw 20 minutes of the film, before they had to write the music, but in the end,​ the album took only 3 months to finish.

                                <br> Hot Space is the tenth studio album by Queen and was released on 21st May 1982 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records in the USA. Hot Space was termed ‘a mistake’ by Brian May, as Queen, failed in an effort to try a different style of music. Queen tried to shidt the style of music with some funk, disco, pop, some R&B. Q Music Magazine actually listed the Hot Space album as one of the “Top 15 Albums where Great Rock acts lost the Plot” – maybe there is a little truth about that. Queen were not in a good place at this time, in reality,​ they were becoming tired of the studio, hence a 2-year gap to the next album.

                                      <br> 
                                      The album ‘The Works’ was released 2 years after the poorly received ‘Hot Space‘ but there was​ still tension in the Queen camp. The intervention of Freddie in some of these​​, may easily have saved Queen from a split.
                                      They worked my harder on this album, but this also caused friction, as they poured over the tuning of individual notes, Brian was a perfectionist, Roger just wanted to get things done and didn’t want to know the difference between F and Fadd9 (see Radio Ga Ga).

                                        <br> 
                                        ‘A Kind of Magic’ contains many songs from the hit movie, Highlander, which is about a group of immortals who can only die if they ‘lose their heads’. Queen had previously written songs for ‘Flash Gordon’ and Russell Mulcahy was shooting the film, Highlander and wanted Queen to do the music, as he couldn’t think of any better band to do it, insisting that the movie needed their anthemic​ songs and their energy. Unlike the Flash soundtrack, there are no instrumentals on the general release of the album, however, an instrumental​ version of ‘Who wants to live Forever’ is included as an Extra Magical Ingredient on the album. The songs which appeared in the film were, ‘A Kind Of Magic’, ‘Who Wants To Live Forever’, ‘Gimme The Prize’, ‘Don’t Lose Your Head’ and ‘Princes Of The Universe’. These 5 songs are very powerful, each in their own way and they really add to the film.

Greatest Hits II was released on 28th October 1991 which was less than a month before the (at that time unexpected) death of Queen’s lead singer Freddie Mercury. This Greatest Hits album was the very last Queen album release of any kind while Freddie was still alive. Vide was becoming evermore important during the 80s, so as a result of this a companion video release entitled The Greatest Flix II was released at the same time.

                                        This is a live album from the Wembley ’86 concert during the Magic Tour. It is over 100 minutes of live quality Queen.
                                        It has some quality tracks and medleys with some great audience participation.

Some of the tracks sound similar to those on Queen I but if you listen carefully you can find differences both in editing and also in length of the songs. Its an interesting album, however only spent 1 week in the UK charts, peaking at No. 67.

Freddie kept saying, “Write me more words … more words”, so they did and when Freddie was well enough they went into the studio and recorded the tracks. Queen knew they were on borrowed tme with Freddies health and did their best to make as much of the time they had, as possible.

Perhaps that is why Queen Rocks is one of the Queen compilations which is enjoyed by fans worldwide.

It includes Queen collaborations with other artists including Elton John, George Michael and David Bowie, as well as solo songs and some remixes – all of which got into the Top 30. An alternate name for the album is Queen+ due to the fact that there are other artists on the album.

                                                            Queen’s flamboyant stage performances and epic songs have made them one of the most enduring Rock groups of the past 30 years. This 51-track triple-CD Anthology is an excellent addition to any record collection – however, most Queen fans will already have all of these songs (perhaps with the section of some songs on the Greatest Hist III CD). It documents this history of the band’s music career. Put this into your triple-changer CD stereo and you will have 3 hours and 28 minutes of the best music from Queens back-catalogue.

It was recorded on 5th of June in Milton Keynes, England during the Hot Space Tour of 1982. In front of 65,000 fans, Queen went and gave a splendid performance that did not disappoint. Personally, I think the show is different than some other Queen concerts in that the arena is more open than in-door concerts, did the music justice.

                                                                                        Queen started their career in the early ’70s, first as Smile and then when John joined, as Queen. They quickly rose to be a force to be reckoned with in the mid-70s. From Queen I to A night at The Opera, it was only 3 years and they had created epic songs during that time. During this time, you may not have known, but Queen recorded 6 radio sessions exclusively for the BBC. In all, there were 24 recordings and they include alternate versions their songs and some have been even totally reimagined. Queen On Air is an album which contains these early recordings.

                                                                                          <br>

The tracks on this compilation album for Bohemian Rhapsody was actually curated by Brian May and Roger Taylor – they picked the very best songs to be included on the movie soundtrack.
The Bohemian Rhapsody album opens with the 20th Century Fox intro as played by Brian May on the Red Special and Roger working on some percussion. The movie soundtrack also includes a few rare Queen songs including Fat Bottomed Girls from the Paris shows of 1979’s Jazz World Tour and the 1985 Rock in Rio rendition of Love of My Life.

Unlike some live albums, such as Queen Live at Wembley ’86, this is from various sources. These include Rock in Rio, Lisbon, the Isle of Wight Festival, Summer Sonic, the Japanese tour, selected UK and North America tour dates, and all 22 minutes of the the Fire Fight Australia benefit show in Australia (which if you didn’t know was the same set list as Queen’s original history-making 1985 Live Aid set in full: namely Bohemian Rhapsody, Radio Ga Ga, Hammer To Fall, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions).
