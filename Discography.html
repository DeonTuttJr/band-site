  <h5 class="center-align"> This section has the complete Queen album discography. This is a list of all their albums in order of release date but only those albums released as Queen. Queen has to have one of the best back catalogues in music history. The Queen musical legacy has broken records worldwide. As of March 2021, Queens Greatest Hits 1 has spent over 940 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and it has also been certified 20 times platinum with sales of over 6 million copies, making it the best-selling album of all time in the United Kingdom. </h5>

  <img src="./images/discography 37.jpeg"><h4>Queen I (July 13, 1973)</h4>
  <br> This is Queen’s 1973 debut album and is probably one of their their most underrated album of that decade. At this stage, 
  Queen had signed a deal with Trident and they had many musical ideas which they were trying out on the album. The self titled album Queen, 
  was recorded during studio off time, when the studio was not being used by more famous artists. Also, this was Freddie’s first opportunity to avail 
  of a full size piano. Already in this album you can hear Brian May’s orchestrated guitar harmonies, the multi-tracked vocal harmonies, 
  imaginative lyrics and musical dynamics which could change from heavy rock to a piano ballad in seconds.

    <img src="./images/discography 36.jpeg"><h4>Queen II (March 8, 1974)</h4>
    <br> The Queen II album had side 1 called “White” and Side 2 called “Black” and funnily enough Brian May had all the songs (bar one) on the white side and Mercury had all the songs on the black side. This Queen II album gave Queen their breakthrough into the UK charts, getting to No.5 in the charts, an improvement of 19 places over the first album. Even with this, it was not thought of as a good album – Rolling Stone in 1974 called it a ” floundering and sadly unoriginal affair “.

      <img src="./images/discography 35.jpeg"width="77%"><h4>Sheer Heart Attack(November 8, 1974)</h4>
      <br> Sheer Heart Attack, was Queens prelude to greatness – it reached number 2 in the UK Album charts and not for lack of trying. The album itself is excellent and pulls no punches by getting straight in there and hitting you with the classic Brian May piece, ‘Brighton Rock’ followed by Queens first real chart hit, ‘Killer Queen’.Brian May also gets his own songs added to the Queen mix. With ‘Now I’m here’, ‘Dear Friends’ and ‘She Makes Me’ as well as contributing an excellent guitar section to ‘Stone Cold Crazy’ which is a very popular cover by bands like Metallica.

        <img src="./images/discography 34.jpeg"width="65%"><h4>A Night At The Opera (November 21, 1975)</h4>
        <br> 
        Queens ‘A Night at the Opera’, is consistently listed in those ‘Top Albums of All time’ style polls which you often see, and for good reason too – it’s​ an excellent album. It ranked #43 in Q Magazines Top Albums poll of 1993 and Mojo Magazine said it was ‘An imperial extravaganza, a cornucopia’. The album is named after the Marx brothers film of the same name, which the band watched during the recording.

          <img src="./images/discography 33.jpeg"><h4>A Day at the Races <br>(December 10, 1976)</h4>
          <br> Queen continued the theme of calling the album after a Marx Brothers film. The album itself starts with one of Queens best early rockers, ‘Tie Your Mother Down’ penned by Brian May and described by the Times as ‘ … Sheer bloody poetry ‘ . Freddie again demonstrates his expertise on the piano with ‘You Take My Breath Away’, which is a moving piece of music which some documentaries used after Freddie’s​ death. The remaining songs on Side 1, ‘Long Away’, ‘The Millionaire Waltz’, and ‘You And I’, all well worth a listen.
          On Side B, there are two songs which ended up on the Greatest Hits compilation, the Aretha Franklin-influenced ‘Somebody to Love’ and the retro-sounding​​ ‘Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy’ which Freddie called another of his ‘vaudeville numbers’ ; There’s even a song with a chorus in Japanese – ‘Teo Torriate (Let Us Cling Together)’ penned by Brian was inspired by Queens early tours of Japan.
