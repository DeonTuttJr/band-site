    Queen History
    Queen is a British rock band founded in 1970 by its singer, Freddie Mercury, Brian May on guitar, Roger Taylor on drums and John Deacon on bass. Despite the absence of some of its members, the band was active until 2009.
    
    Brian May and Roger Taylor founded the band Smile in 1968, with Tim Staffell as the vocalist. He studied with Freddie Mercury at Ealing Art College, who was a big fan of the band. Therefore, when Tim Staffell left the group to join another, Humpy Bong, May and Taylor immediately thought of Mercury. Once the three of them were together, Smile’s name became Queen’s at the suggestion of Freddie himself. After playing songs of other bands and artists, they renewed some that they had composed for Smile and other previous bands.</p>
